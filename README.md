# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louiseâ€™s play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Using Kickstarter data, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose

To find out the best time to launch a fundraising campaign for theater-based projects. Also, to bring to the surface additional insights that can lead to future successful fundraising campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- See chart under resources.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- See chart under resources

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I redid the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals numerous times and still could not duplicate the chart provided in the assignment. I suspect I introduced an error into the data but could not find it. The challenge is knowing how to troubleshoot and fix data errors when they occur.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. Based on the data, the month of May is the best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign for theater-based projects. (111 out of 839 projects succeeded or 13.23%). The data tells the hopeful tale that starting in spring and peaking in the early summer months, donors to Kickstarter campaigns may have a brighter more generous outlook and more likely to open their wallets to fund theater projects. 

2. Based on the data, Dec is the worst month to launch a Kickstarter campaign. (Only 37 out of 839 projects succeeded or 4.42%). The data tells the story that in December potential Kickstarter givers may be directing their funds to other activities, (Christmas related spending perhaps, as this data is based on outcomes from Western countries).     

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on the data, projects with the Kickstarter fundraising goals of between 1K to 4,999, 20K - 24,999 and 25K to 39,999 were all 100 % successful. Similar projects targeting Kickstarter fundraising goals of over 50K has the lowest success rate of 26%. The projects with a Kickstarter fundraising goal of 30K to 34,999 had the highest number of number of successes at 458 or 80%. 
 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The data provided only focused on several mostly western countries so, we do not know how similar fundraising programs would perform in the rest of the world.
